        <p class="text-center">We respect values and believe in giving and sharing to society. That is the main reason
            why we started our NGO. My parents taught us to give back to the community and to be optimistic about the
            future.From childhood, I saw how my father helped out in our local communities, and we were taught that
            anything is
            possible with giving and sharing. Unfortunately, some outliers make it hard for some people to reach their
            potential: things like when they were born, limitations of who their parents are, Culture, where they grew
            up, and the environment in which they have lived their childhood.<br>
            My parents thought to use resources and my skills to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to
            lead a healthy and happy life. Most importantly, we believe this: All lives are valuable, and they have a
            fundamental need to live a healthy and happy life. <br>

                <p>The challenge we always have was how to do that in a meaningful, right and create high-impact. Our
                    NGO
                    was drawn to things that sprang from experiences throughout, so we began donating supplies to the
                    poor
                    across Manthani to have everyone eat three meals daily. As we traveled more, we also became curious
                    about inequalities further from home. We started helping them when they are sick. We built a
                    hospital to
                    treat the patients with a nominal amount. We began consulting experts in each village, learning from
                    locals where we wanted to work and help and poverty more deeply with our initiatives.</p>

                <p>We provided employment for youth by starting IT company and other small employment, local business
                    opportunities as we can. We also provided education to the underprivileged youth by providing
                    financial
                    help. We donated books, several PCS, gym equipment, and provide sports facilities in the schools. We
                    tried to make sure that every student had an equal opportunity to learn, graduate, and succeed.
                    We are trying new ways and plan activities out how we might use our voices to raise the visibility
                    of
                    health and education and how our resources could start saving and transforming the lives of the
                    poor.</p>

                    it's unfortunate to see their lives during that stage. They cannot afford any medical treatment due
                    to financial constraints.<br>
